# Gistory

A script that uses the Github API to query a user’s publicly available gists.

When the script is first run, it should display a listing of all the user’s publicly available gists. On subsequent runs the script should list any gists that have been published since the last run.

The script may optionally provide other functionality (possibly via additional command line flags).
