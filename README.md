# Gistory

A script that uses the Github API to query a user’s publicly available gists.

When the script is first run, it should display a listing of all the user’s publicly available gists. On subsequent runs the script should list any gists that have been published since the last run.

The script may optionally provide other functionality (possibly via additional command line flags).

## Prequisites

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
